	  Say Y here if you want to use the Atmel AT73C213 external DAC. This
	  DAC can be found on Atmel development boards.

	  This driver requires the Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a
	  peripheral found on most AT91 and AVR32 microprocessors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called snd-at73c213.

	help
	  Sets the target bitrate for the bitrate calculator in the driver.
	  Limited by hardware to be between 8000 Hz and 50000 Hz.

	  Set to 48000 Hz by default.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the CS4271 codec. This
	  codec can be found on the EMAC Inc SOM-150 carrier.

	  This driver requires the Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a
	  peripheral found on most AT91 and AVR32 microprocessors.
